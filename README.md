<h2>Saving Work to Repository</h2>
<li>1) First run <code>git diff [directory/file changed]</code> to view changes and confirm what you want to upload and then run <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git pull origin master</code> to make sure you are up to date and resolve any conflicts before making new changes</li>

<li>2) Then run <code>git checkout –b [branch name (all one word)]</code> to create a new branch. Make the name describe your work in two to three words max here</li>

<li>3) Then run <code>git add [directory/file changed]</code> to stage your changes for uploading</li>

<li>4) Run <code>git commit –m “[description]”</code> (note the double quotes) to give your work a short description in order to quickly identify what was changed</li>

<li>5) Run <code>git push origin [branch name]</code>, where branch name is the one created in step 2.</li>

<li>6) Check the repo and confirm that your branch shows up under the branch menu</li>
